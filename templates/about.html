            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                WeLearn is a web-based platform designed to support Chinese language learning. By leveraging real-world conversations from messaging platforms like WeChat, WeLearn provides a context-driven approach for learning vocabulary, pronunciation, and sentence structure in Chinese.
            </p>

            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vocabulary Management:</strong> Automatically identify and store new words from conversations, along with pinyin and English translations.</li>
                <li><strong>Examples and Sentences:</strong> For each new word, WeLearn displays example sentences from real conversations, helping users understand usage in different contexts.</li>
                <li><strong>Difficulty Ratings:</strong> Users can rate the difficulty of each word, making it easier to track and prioritize learning.</li>
                <li><strong>Writing Practice:</strong> A handwriting canvas lets users practice writing Chinese characters without accidental page scrolling.</li>
                <li><strong>Progress Tracking:</strong> Track vocabulary learning progress with examples and ratings.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Benefits</h2>
            <p>
                WeLearn aims to provide a personalized learning experience by focusing on the vocabulary most relevant to the userâ€™s real-life communication needs. The project not only enhances language retention but also promotes a more practical understanding of the Chinese language.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
            <p>
                This project is built with <strong>Flask</strong>, a Python web framework, and uses <strong>Jieba</strong> for Chinese text segmentation. The database management is handled through SQLAlchemy for secure and efficient data processing.
